**accessControlListBase64** | **String** | Reserved for DocuSign. | [optional]

**allowMarkup** | **String** | When **true,** the Document Markup feature is enabled.  **Note:**  To use this feature, Document Markup must be enabled at both the account and envelope levels. Only Admin users can change this setting at the account level.  | [optional]

When the envelope is created, the status is `Processing` and an `envelopeId` is not returned in the response. To get the `envelopeId`, use a GET envelope query by using the [transactionId](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/create/) or by checking the Connect notification. | [optional]
