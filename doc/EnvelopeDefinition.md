## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**accessControlListBase64** | **String** | Reserved for DocuSign. | [optional] 
**accessibility** | **String** | Sets the document reading zones for screen reader applications.  This element can only be used if Document Accessibility is enabled for the account.  **Note:** This information is currently generated from the DocuSign web console by setting the reading zones when creating a template, exporting the reading zone string information, and adding it here. | [optional] 
**allowComments** | **String** | When **true,** comments are allowed on the envelope. | [optional] 
**allowMarkup** | **String** | When **true,** the Document Markup feature is enabled.  **Note:**  To use this feature, Document Markup must be enabled at both the account and envelope levels. Only Admin users can change this setting at the account level.  | [optional] 
**allowReassign** | **String** | When **true,** the recipient can redirect an envelope to a more appropriate recipient. | [optional] 
**allowRecipientRecursion** | **String** | When **true,** this enables the Recursive Recipients feature and allows a recipient to appear more than once in the routing order. | [optional] 
**allowViewHistory** | **String** | When **true,** users can view the history of the envelope. | [optional] 
**anySigner** | **String** | Deprecated. This feature has been replaced by signing groups. | [optional] 
**asynchronous** | **String** | When **true,** the envelope is queued for processing and the value of the `status` property is set to `Processing`. Additionally, GET status calls return `Processing` until completed.   **Note:** A `transactionId` is required for this call to work correctly. When the envelope is created, the status is `Processing` and an `envelopeId` is not returned in the response. To get the `envelopeId`, use a GET envelope query by using the [transactionId](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/create/) or by checking the Connect notification. | [optional] 
**attachments** | [**List<Attachment>**](Attachment.md) | An array of attachment objects containing details about any envelope attachments. | [optional] [default to const []]
**attachmentsUri** | **String** | The URI for retrieving the envelope attachments. | [optional] 
**authoritativeCopy** | **String** | When **true,** marks all of the documents in the envelope as authoritative copies.  **Note:** You can override this value for a specific document. For example, you can set the `authoritativeCopy` property to **true** at the envelope level, but turn it off for a single document by setting the `authoritativeCopy` property for the document to **false.** | [optional] 
**authoritativeCopyDefault** | **String** | The default `authoritativeCopy` setting for documents in this envelope that do not have `authoritativeCopy` set. If this property is not set, each document defaults to the envelope's `authoritativeCopy`. | [optional] 
**autoNavigation** | **String** | When **true,** autonavigation is set for the recipient.  | [optional] 
**brandId** | **String** | The ID of the brand, or text and formatting, to use for the envelope. To use brands, account branding must be enabled for the account.  **Note:** When creating an envelope using a branded template, include this value to ensure that the brand is applied. | [optional] 
**brandLock** | **String** | When **true,** the `brandId` for the envelope is locked and senders cannot change the brand used for the envelope. | [optional]

There can be any number of Composite Template structures in the envelope. | [optional] [default to const []]
**copyRecipientData** | **String** | This value is only applicable when copying an existing envelope. Provide the ID of the envelope to clone in `envelopeId`.

**documentBase64** | **String** | The document's bytes. This field can be used to include a base64 version of the document bytes within an envelope definition instead of sending the document using a multi-part HTTP request. The maximum document size is smaller if this field is used due to the overhead of the base64 encoding. | [optional]

Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded by using this setting when an envelope is sent.  **Note:** To use this functionality, [Document Visibility][docviz] must be enabled for the account by making the account setting `allowDocumentVisibility` **true.**  [docviz]: /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopedocumentvisibility/ | [optional]
