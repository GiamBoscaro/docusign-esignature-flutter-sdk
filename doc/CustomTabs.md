## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**anchor** | **String** | An optional string that is used to auto-match tabs to strings located in the documents of an envelope. | [optional] 
**anchorCaseSensitive** | **String** | This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**  For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.  This functionality uses the following rules:  - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:    $~><|^+=    For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`  - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.  - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.    Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**  - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.  - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.    Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.  - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.    Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).  **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.  [AnchorTabs]: /docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/ | [optional] 
**anchorHorizontalAlignment** | **String** | This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :  - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value. - `right`: Aligns the tabâ€™s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.  **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.  [AnchorTabs]: /docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/  | [optional] 
**anchorIgnoreIfNotPresent** | **String** | When **true,** this tab is ignored if the `anchorString` is not found in the document. | [optional] 
**anchorMatchWholeWord** | **String** | When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**  For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.  This functionality uses the following rules:  - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:    $~><|^+=    For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`  - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.  - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.    Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**  - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.  - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.    Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.  - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.    Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).   **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.
